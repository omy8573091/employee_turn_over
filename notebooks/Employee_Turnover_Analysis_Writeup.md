- Moderate project load and working hours
- Low turnover risk

**Cluster 2: Overworked Employees**
- High evaluation but low satisfaction
- High project count and working hours
- High turnover risk

**Cluster 3: Underutilized Employees**

- Moderate satisfaction and evaluation
- Medium turnover risk

**Cluster 4: Disengaged Employees**
- Low satisfaction and evaluation scores

## 4. Machine Learning Model Development

### 4.1 Class Imbalance Handling
- **Challenge:** 76.2% stayed vs 23.8% left (imbalanced dataset)
- **Solution:** SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
- **Result:** Balanced dataset for improved model performance

### 4.2 Model Comparison

| Model | F1-Score | AUC | Recall | Precision |
|-------|----------|-----|--------|-----------|
| **Gradient Boosting** | **0.981** | **0.994** | **0.955** | **0.965** |
| Random Forest | 0.956 | 0.994 | 0.931 | 0.982 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.666 | 0.847 | 0.824 | 0.559 |

### 4.3 Model Performance Analysis

**Gradient Boosting (Best Model):**
- **True Positives:** 682 (correctly predicted employees who left)
- **True Negatives:** 2,261 (correctly predicted employees who stayed)
- **False Positives:** 25 (incorrectly predicted employees would leave)
- **False Negatives:** 32 (missed employees who actually left)

**Business Justification for Metrics:**
- **Recall prioritized over Precision:** False negatives (missing employees who leave) cost 20x more than false positives
- **Cost of turnover:** $100,000 per employee vs $5,000 for retention efforts
- **ROI focus:** Better to identify 100 at-risk employees (including 20 false positives) than miss 20 who actually leave

| **High Risk Zone (Red)** | 3,333 | 22.2% | > 80% |
| **Medium Risk Zone (Orange)** | 127 | 0.8% | 60-80% |
| **Low Risk Zone (Yellow)** | 431 | 2.9% | 20-60% |

### Financial Impact Analysis
- **High-risk employees:** 3,460 total
- **Potential turnover cost:** $346,000,000
